"""Regression tests for issue #32.

``DrummerPlugin.get_signature_fills()`` is implemented by every drummer
plugin, but prior to this fix nothing in the generation pipeline ever
called it: ``DrumGenerator._generate_fills()`` only consulted
``GenrePlugin.get_common_fills()``. A drummer's signature fills were dead
code from the perspective of actual song generation.

These tests prove:
  1. When a drummer with signature fills is requested, that request is
     treated as a drummer-inspired performance: fills are drawn
     exclusively from the drummer's candidates, not diluted by the
     genre's stock fills.
  2. Drummers with no signature fills (the pre-Peart default) fall back
     to the genre's common fill pool unchanged.
  3. With no drummer set at all, fills come from the genre pool only
     (unchanged baseline behavior).
  4. A drummer's signature fill can actually be selected and rendered into
     the generated MIDI output for a full song generation call - not just
     that ``get_signature_fills()`` returns data in isolation.
